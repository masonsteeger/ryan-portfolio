          <h1>Hi, I&#39;m Ryan Leach</h1>
          <p>
            I am a passionate tattoo artist with 5 years of experience. From a
            young age, art inspired me, and I always knew it would shape my
            career. I found tattooing during a pivotal moment in my life,
            serving as an escape and a way to transform people&#39;s ideas into
            unique self expressive art. I specialize in geometric designs but
            also enjoy floral, ornamental, and black and grey realism tattoos.{" "}
            Tattooing has profoundly changed my life, and the friendships and
            artist knowledge I&#39;ve made and learned are among my most
            cherished achievements. <br />I am happily married to my best friend
            and biggest supporter. We are parents to the most beautiful
            two-year-old daughter, and happy furry family of 2 cats and a mini
            Aussie. In addition to tattooing, I pursue glass engraving,
            painting, home d√©cor refinishing and creating digital art for
            clothing. I spend most of my time enjoying it with family and
            attending music festivals.
