            <h2>Hi, I&#39;m Ryan Leach</h2>
            <p>
              I am a passionate tattoo artist with 5 years of experience. From a
              young age, art inspired me, and I always knew it would shape my
              career. I found tattooing during a pivotal moment in my life,
              serving as an escape and a way to transform people&#39;s ideas
              into unique self expressive art. I specialize in geometric designs
              but also enjoy floral, ornamental, and black and grey realism
              tattoos. Tattooing has profoundly changed my life, and the
              friendships and artist knowledge I&#39;ve made and learned are
              among my most cherished achievements. <br />I am happily married
              to my best friend and biggest supporter. We are parents to the
              most beautiful two-year-old daughter, and happy furry family of 2
              cats and a mini Aussie. In addition to tattooing, I pursue glass
              engraving, painting, home d√©cor refinishing and creating digital
              art for clothing. I spend most of my time enjoying it with family
              and attending music festivals.
